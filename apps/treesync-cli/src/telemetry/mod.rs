//! Lives in the CLI rather than the library because it is a property of a
//! *process*, not of syncing: it installs a global subscriber, which is a

//! that did this would fight whatever its host application had already set up.
//! [`treesync`] emits `tracing` events and leaves collecting them to the caller.
